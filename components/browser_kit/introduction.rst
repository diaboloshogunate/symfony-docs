The BrowserKit Component
========================

    The BrowserKit component simulates the behavior of a web browser.

The BrowserKit component allows you to make web request, click on links and submit forms. 

Installation
------------

You can install the component in 2 different ways:

* :doc:`Install it via Composer </components/using_components>` (``symfony/browser-kit`` on `Packagist`_);
* Use the official Git repository (https://github.com/symfony/BrowserKit).

Usage
-----

.. note::
    The component only provide an abstract client and does not provide any "default" backend for the HTTP layer.

Creating a Client

For a simple implementation of a browser based on an HTTP layer, have a look at Goutte_.

For an implementation based on HttpKernelInterface, have a look at the Client provided by the :doc:`/components/http_kernel/introduction`.
